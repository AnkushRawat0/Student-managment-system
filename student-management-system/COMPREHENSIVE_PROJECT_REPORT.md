├── Coach (1:1 with User) 
└── Relationships managed via foreign keys

Course (with status lifecycle)
├── Coach assignment (Many:1)
└── Student enrollment (1:Many)
```

### **✅ Database Strengths:**

coachAssignmentSchema // New coach assignment workflow
courseSchema         // Course validation with coach assignment
loginSchema          // Authentication validation
registerSchema       // User registration validation
```

#### **🎯 Interface Definitions**
```typescript
// Comprehensive type coverage
Student              // Complete student type with relations
Coach                // Coach with course assignments
Course               // Course with coach and student relations
User                 // Base user with role typing
StudentFormData      // Form-specific typing
CourseFormData       // Course creation typing
CoachAssignmentData  // Coach assignment typing
```

### **✅ Type Safety Strengths**

#### **🔄 End-to-End Type Flow**
1. **Database Schema** → Prisma types
2. **Prisma Types** → API route typing
3. **API Types** → Zod validation
4. **Zod Types** → Frontend components

## 🏪 5. STORE ARCHITECTURE & DATA FLOW

### **🏗️ Zustand Store Structure**

#### **👥 Student Store (`studentStore.ts`)**
```typescript
// State Management
students: Student[]              // All student data
filteredStudents: Student[]      // Search/filter results
filters: StudentFilters          // Search and filter state
isLoading: boolean              // Loading states
error: string | null            // Error handling

// UI State
showAddModal: boolean           // Modal controls
showEditModal: boolean
showDeleteDialog: boolean
selectedStudent: Student | null // Selected for operations

// Actions
fetchStudents()                 // Data fetching
createStudent()                 // Student creation
updateStudent()                 // Student updates
deleteStudent()                 // Student deletion
setFilters()                    // Filter management
applyFilters()                  // Real-time filtering
```

#### **📚 Course Store (`courseStore.ts`)**
```typescript
// Course Management
courses: Course[]               // All courses with relations
loading: boolean               // Loading states
error: string | null          // Error handling

// UI State  
isAddModalOpen: boolean       // Modal controls
isEditModalOpen: boolean
isDeleteModalOpen: boolean
selectedCourse: Course | null // Current selection

// Actions
fetchCourses()               // Load courses with coach/students
addCourse()                  // Create with coach assignment
updateCourse()               // Update course details
deleteCourse()               // Safe deletion
```

#### **👨‍🏫 Coach Store (`coachStore.ts`)**
```typescript
// Coach Management
coaches: Coach[]             // All coaches with courses
loading: boolean            // Loading states
error: string | null       // Error handling
filters: CoachFilters      // Filter state

// UI State
isAddModalOpen: boolean    // Modal controls  
isEditModalOpen: boolean
isDeleteModalOpen: boolean
selectedCoach: Coach | null // Current selection

// Actions
fetchCoaches()            // Load with course assignments
addCoach()               // NEW: Assign existing user to coach role
updateCoach()            // Update coach information
deleteCoach()            // Remove coach assignment
```

#### **🔐 Auth Store (`authStore.ts`)**
```typescript
// Authentication State
user: User | null           // Current user data
isLoggedIn: boolean        // Authentication status
loading: boolean          // Loading states
error: string | null     // Error handling

// Actions
login()                  // User authentication
register()               // User registration  
logout()                 // Session cleanup
checkAuth()              // Session validation
```

### **✅ Store Architecture Strengths**

#### **🔄 Data Flow Pattern**
1. **Component** triggers action
2. **Store action** calls API
3. **API response** updates store state
4. **Store state change** triggers component re-render
5. **UI reflects** new data automatically

#### **🎯 State Management Benefits**
- **Centralized state** for consistent data
- **Automatic persistence** for user experience
- **Real-time updates** across all components
- **Error handling** at store level
- **Loading states** for better UX

#### **🔄 Store Interactions**
```typescript
// Cross-store dependencies
StudentStore → CourseStore    // Student enrollment requires course data
CourseStore → CoachStore      // Course creation requires coach data  
AuthStore → All Stores        // Role-based data filtering
```
